## Layout and tools

The whole project is built as a Maven project, including the Vue-based frontend, which is located in `demyo-vue-frontend`. The frontend is still a regular NPM project as well and will be run as such during development.

Maven can easily be run using the `mvnw` command.

This project can be conveniently opened in VSCode using `../Demyo.code-workspace`. Once open, it provides a set of recommended extensions that you are free to install or not. Launch configurations are also provided.

Alternatively, code style settings and other configuration items for Eclipse are available in the `../config` directory.
