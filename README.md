## Description
Demyo is a Comic Manager intented for local usage trough a Web interface.

This project is the Java port / upgrade of the existing PHP software available at http://www.demyo.org/en/ .

## Contributing
At the moment, I do not accept contributions. I don't have time to manage them, and the software is not at a sufficient point in its development in my opinion.

Eventually, I could accept merge requests.
