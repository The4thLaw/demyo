## Description
Demyo is a free and open source comic and book manager intended for local usage trough a Web interface. It is (subjectively) aesthetically pleasing and designed to fit both casual readers wanting to catalog their collections and obsessive dans who want to document every little detail.

Unlike generic collection managers such as GCstar or Tellico, Demyo is exclusively meant to index books and everything connected to them (including collectibles). As such, it does a better job of structuring the appropriate data but is also ill-fitted for other items such as movies.

Moderately technical users can also host it like any other Java Web application.
