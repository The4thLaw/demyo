# Contributing to Demyo

Hello and thank you for considering a contribution to Demyo :)

I don't really have time to manage a team of active maintainers, but you can still help.

## How to help

### Submitting content

There are two kinds of contributions that are particularly appreciated and for which I would gladly review pull requests:
 - Translations in languages other than English and French
 - Bug fixes

If you want to translate Demyo in your own language and don't know how to do it technically, feel free to open an issue to offer your help. There are user-friendly tools which are free for Open Source projects, and I could look into them.

### Submitting issues

Even if you don't have the knowledge to implement a feature request or fix an issue, you can still submit your ideas in the issue tracker. Someone may eventually pick them up. At the very least, you'll get an idea as to whether this is part of the intended scope of Demyo or not.

When submitting issues, please make sure you follow the provided template.

## Guidelines

If you want to actively contribute and submit code for Demyo, please make sure you comply with the following:
 - The code complies with the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
